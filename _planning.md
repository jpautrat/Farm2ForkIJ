- Multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations
- Session management and timeout
- Account lockout after failed login attempts

### Data Protection
- HTTPS for all communications
- Database encryption for sensitive data
- PCI DSS compliance for payment information
- Data minimization principles
- Regular security audits
- Privacy by design approach

### API Security
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration

## Design Decisions and Tradeoffs

### Monolithic vs. Microservices
**Decision**: Start with a modular monolith with clear boundaries between components, designed to be split into microservices later if needed.
**Rationale**: Simpler initial development and deployment, while maintaining the option to scale specific components independently as the platform grows.

### SQL vs. NoSQL Database
**Decision**: Use MongoDB (NoSQL) as the primary database.
**Rationale**: The schema flexibility is beneficial for a marketplace with diverse product attributes and categories. Document structure aligns well with product listings and user profiles.

### Server-Side Rendering vs. Client-Side Rendering
**Decision**: Use client-side rendering with server-side rendering for critical pages (product listings, home page).
**Rationale**: Balances SEO needs with interactive user experience. Critical pages benefit from faster initial load times and SEO advantages of SSR.

### Authentication Strategy
**Decision**: JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens.
**Rationale**: Provides stateless authentication that scales well, while refresh tokens enhance security and user experience by reducing the frequency of logins.

### Payment Processing
**Decision**: Integrate with Stripe as the primary payment processor.
**Rationale**: Comprehensive API, strong security features, and wide acceptance of payment methods. The trade-off is slightly higher transaction fees compared to some alternatives.

### Image Storage and Processing
**Decision**: Use AWS S3 for storage with a CDN for delivery and on-the-fly image resizing.
**Rationale**: Scalable, reliable storage with optimized delivery. The cost is justified by performance benefits and reduced server load.

### Search Implementation
**Decision**: Implement Elasticsearch for product search.
**Rationale**: Provides advanced search capabilities (fuzzy matching, faceted search) that enhance user experience, at the cost of additional infrastructure complexity.

### Mobile Strategy
**Decision**: Responsive web design rather than native mobile apps initially.
**Rationale**: Faster time-to-market and broader reach with a single codebase. Native apps can be developed later based on user demand and platform growth.
