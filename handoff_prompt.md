# Farm2Fork Project Handoff

## Project Overview
Farm2Fork is a modern e-commerce platform that connects local farmers directly with consumers. The mission is to promote sustainable agriculture, support local farmers, and provide consumers with access to fresh, locally-sourced food. The platform enables farmers to list their fresh produce, meats, and dairy products for sale, while consumers can browse, purchase, and arrange shipping directly from the producers.

## Project Goals
1. Create a fully functional, browser- and mobile-friendly web application
2. Enable secure buyer/seller logins and role-based access
3. Implement product listings with descriptions, images, categories, and pricing
4. Develop a shopping cart and checkout system
5. Integrate payment processing (Stripe)
6. Implement shipping estimation and logistics
7. Create responsive design for both desktop and mobile users
8. Develop an admin control panel for moderation and support

## Important Considerations
1. Security is a top priority, especially for payment processing and user data
   - All sensitive data must be encrypted
   - API endpoints must validate user permissions
   - Payment information should never be stored directly
   - Input validation must be implemented on both frontend and backend

2. The application must be responsive and work well on mobile devices
   - Use responsive design principles throughout
   - Test on various screen sizes and devices
   - Optimize images and assets for mobile

3. Performance optimization is important for a smooth user experience
   - Implement pagination for large data sets
   - Use indexing for frequently queried fields
   - Optimize frontend bundle size
   - Implement caching where appropriate

4. Accessibility should be considered throughout development
   - Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines
   - Use semantic HTML
   - Ensure proper contrast ratios
   - Support keyboard navigation

5. The codebase should follow best practices and be maintainable
   - Use consistent coding style
   - Write clear documentation
   - Follow the DRY principle
   - Implement proper error handling

This handoff document provides a comprehensive overview of the Farm2Fork project, its current state, and what remains to be done. The project is approximately 55% complete, with significant progress made on both the backend and frontend foundations. The core functionality for user authentication, product management, and payment processing is in place, but there is still substantial work needed to complete the full e-commerce experience, especially in the areas of shipping, inventory management, and the admin/seller dashboards.
